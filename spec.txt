i didnt know what are the steps to get this setup locally. here's what i tried:

brew install jsonnet
make
make kubernetes.yaml

go get github.com/metalmatze/slo-libsonnet

docker build -t "sentinel-config:Dockerfile" .

docker run -d -v ${PWD}:/app -p 9099:9099 --name sentinel-config sentinel-config:Dockerfile

docker run --rm -it sentinel-config:Dockerfile /bin/sh

create PCX to fix broken link in WAF changelog

GO111MODULE="on" go get github.com/jsonnet-bundler/jsonnet-bundler/cmd/jb

Requirements:

there are two fields which an SE should enter, and then the template should be populated.
1.  domain names, separated by |
2.  the budget multiplier.
so need a page where the customer enters the two variables, and a template is generated for them.

for the multiplier...
the variable is a percentage... for example, the SE enters 99.9%
and the calculation should be 1 - 0.99900
so percentage / 100... and then subtracted from 1.

the variables are titled: 
- Zone names (separated by |)
- Availability SLO

we will need to add bout 3 more variables over time

for now just two variables... zone names, and "Availability SLO"

in future we will need stuff like:
1.  Security SLO
2.  Origin RTT
3.  Edge RTT
4.  Gatebot Threshold
but not too many more... just 3 - 4 more.
